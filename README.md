dice with animation
come on guys, I'm almost there, I've made it... not quite there yet but small progress 
i still need if someone can check the connection between the javascript and the lua code when using the object 

Dice

I almost have the die, with the movement generated by javascript and css, if you have some time, I would like you to review it.

Since I currently have two bugs according to what I've found out 

The first one is that I think that the generation of the random number match.random(1, 6) between the js code and lua is not related at all.
And then the activation of the animation between lua and js.

#new small changes, but now I just have to get the js function that does the animation to run when I use the item
